# Emergence of evolutionary stable correlation as a core problem of social ontology

## Introduction
In this paper, I argue that the emergence of evolutionary stable correlation is a core issue of naturalistic social ontology. Social institutions are the central unit of social ontology [@guala2016b], and coordination is its main mechanism rooted in evolution [@shevchenko2023]. As institutions are normative-driven behavioral regularities designed to solve coordination problems [@aoki2007], they share many features with 'animal conventions' that help animals solve coordination problems and maintain stable relationships [@hindriks2015]. Consequently, understanding the emergence of social institutions requires an examination of the evolutionary mechanisms that enable the correlation of strategies with normative force as a key characteristic.
