# Emergence of evolutionary stable correlation as a core problem of social ontology

## Introduction
In this paper, I argue that the emergence of evolutionary stable correlation is the core issue of naturalistic social ontology. According to rules-in-equilibria theory, social institutions are the central unit of social ontology [@guala2016b], and coordination is its main mechanism rooted in evolution [@shevchenko2023]. As institutions are normatively-driven self-sustaining behavioral regularities designed to solve coordination problems [@aoki2007], they share many features with 'animal conventions' that help animals solve coordination problems and maintain stable relationships [@hindriks2015]. Consequently, understanding the emergence of social institutions requires an examination of the evolutionary mechanisms that enable correlation of strategies with normative force as a key characteristic.

To expand, let us first look at Guala's [-@guala2016b] argument that has the following logic:

1. social institutions are backed not by constitutive rules of the form "X counts as Y in (the context of) C", like in Searle [-@searle1995],[^1] but by regulative rules of the form "do X if Y"
2. from a game-theoretic point of view, regulative rules can be seen as agents' strategies that comprise a *correlated equilibrium*[^2]
3. constitutive rules are linguistically transformed regulative rules with added theoretical term that represents a certain equilibrium
4. at the same time, many animal species including baboons, lions, swallowtails, and others exhibit behavioral patterns describable in the form of correlated equilibrium, as well [@maynardsmith1982]
5. despite the similarity of mathematical representation, the cases of 'animal conventions' and human social institutions differ in scope of actionable signals. Building on Sterelny [-@sterelny2003], Guala puts for forward an idea that humans can invent and follow new rules, whereas animals are bound to genetically inherited sets of behavioral responses
6. the arbitrariness of rules that humans can invent and follow is grounded in and ontologically depends on shared representations of a given community
7. put differently, the difference in scope of actionable signals between animals and humans can be explained by humans having social epistemology that grounds social ontology.

Although sound, this argument has an Achilles heel: the evolutionary roots of correlation of strategies as the basis of any self-sustaining social coordination, human or not, are still obscure and underdeveloped.

Guala and Hindriks base their account on Maynard Smith's, who does not use the notion of correlated eqiulibrium explicitly and discusses what he calls a *bourgeois equilibrium* — a situation in animal territorial behavior, when the most optimal strategy for an animal is to fight for a territory it "owns" it or not fight otherwise. This game is represented in the matrix below.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
& \textbf{Hawk} & \textbf{Dove} & \textbf{Bourgeois} \\ \hline
\textbf{Hawk} & $\frac{(V-C)}{2}$, $\frac{(V-C)}{2}$ & $V$, $0$ & $\frac{(V-C)}{2}$, $V-C$ \\ \hline
\textbf{Dove} & $0$, $V$ & $\frac{V}{2}$, $\frac{V}{2}$ & $0$, $\frac{V}{2}$ \\ \hline
\textbf{Bourgeois} & $C-V$, $\frac{(C-V)}{2}$ & $\frac{(C-V)}{2}$, $C-V$ & $\frac{(C-V)}{2}$, $\frac{(C-V)}{2}$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\small A game-theoretic matrix for a "hawk-dove-bourgeois" game from Maynard Smith's book "Evolution and theory of games". In this game, two players (represented by rows and columns) can choose to be either a hawk (fight for resources), dove (submit and share resources), or bourgeois (submit only when opponent is also bourgeois). The payoffs are determined by the value of the resource (V) and the cost of fighting (C). The table shows the payoff for each player given their own strategy and their opponent's strategy.}
\end{table}

Guala and Hindriks interpret bourgeois equilibrium as a correlated one. However, there are at least two interpretations of it: *correlated equilibrium* and *evolutionary stable strategy* (ESS) based on uncorrelated asymmetry. They are mathematically distinct, and we will look at both in detail later.

The presented ambiguity creates tension at the backbone of Guala's argument. It means that:
- either 'animal conventions' are mathematically different from human social institutions, for they represent ESS and not correlated equilibrium, and there comes the burden of showing how the former becomes the latter in the course of evolution;
- or that 'animal conventions' are themselves correlated, and there comes the burden of showing how humans acquired the capacity for social epistemology that ontologically grounds social ontology as rules-in-equilibria.

Taking into account the wealth of research on transition from ESS to correlation in game theory [@skyrms1994; @lee-penagos2016; @kim2017; @metzger2018; @herrmann2021], the first option in resolving the tension in Guala's argument becomes insufficient. The transition from ESS to correlation does not intrinsically presuppose the emergence of intentional compliance to norms, as in social institutions, which are normatively-driven and at the same time arbitrary, as will be covered later. Consequently, it will be needed to account for the second option, but to begin, we need to figure out whether social institutions indeed necessitate correlation of strategies. In this paper, I will address the source of the issue—Maynard Smith's notion of bourgeois equilibrium and its interpretations in regard to social coordination.

It is relevant, for if social institutions have emerged from 'animal conventions' with the aid of cognitive capacities like mindreading and/or mindshaping [@zawidzki2013], it constrains social ontology as the scope of possible objects of study to the logical derivatives of social institutions and social coordination in general as discussed in @shevchenko2023.

This paper is structured as follows. First, it discusses the relationship between social institutions, conventions, and norms, and how conventions emerge through Skyrms's deliberational dynamics and Harms's evolutionary functionalism. Second, it examines the correlation and asymmetry of strategies in the emergence of social institutions and explains what correlated equilibrium and uncorrelated asymmetry mean. Two views on correlation versus asymmetry are also discussed. Third, the paper explores the problem with correlation in social institutions as evolved correlated equilibria. It analyzes Guala's argument about the difference in scope of actionable signals in animals versus humans and Skyrms's interpretation of Maynard Smith's “bourgeois” concept. Fourth, it delves into the tension between bourgeois and correlated equilibria with a formal distinction between mixed strategy and correlated equilibria, as well as addressing where randomization of strategies comes from.
