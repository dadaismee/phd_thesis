# Introduction
Scientific ontology describes objects of study for a given scientific discipline. Starting with "what do we study", we proceed to "how and with what methods can we gain reliable knowledge" about a given phenomenon. This algorithm is not different for social ontology. However, there are inherent difficulties with its application, for social ontology is not underpinned by any overarching principle like evolution in biology or lawful regularity expressible in mathematical form in economics.

â€¦

Social ontology needs naturalistic constraints to more precisely define the objects of study, epistemology, and methodology of social science.
